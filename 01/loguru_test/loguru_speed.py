Eye Pressure Lowering Effect of Vitamin C
Herschell H. Boyd, M.D.1
Purpose
To document the pressure before the use
of vitamin C and after the daily intake of
maximum amounts of vitamin C, three times
a day.
Methods
Thirty patients (16 men and 14 women)
were advised to take three divided doses of
vitamin C in capsule form each day until
loose stools occured and then back downslightly from this amount (bowel dosage) for
a daily intake. Average daily intake for all
patients was 10 grams per day.

was a smoker in her early fifties, and she hascontinued to smoke with good reason to
cease.
Glaucoma accompanies the cataract pa-
tients so a daily intake of vitamin C could
save the country literally in the billions of
dollars. This would admittedly be detrimen-tal to the financial health of ophthalmolo-
gists, but of course this is not the issue.
Ascorbic acid has been reported to be of
paid by research grants from drug compa-nies and from the National Institute of Health
in Washington, D.C. These two areas don't
fund vitamin C. If a source of private moneycould be found, the medical school would be
pleased to do studies as desired. A private
foundation may be the salvation of the glau-coma patients, and, of course, the many
other areas we need to treat.
Conclusion
1. Vitamin C does lower the intraocular
pressure in all patients with elevatedpressure.
use eye drops to lower the pressure below 20mm of mercury as they refused to take vita-
min C.
Conclusion
In this series of 30 patients there was no
occasion in which the pressure was not low-ered with vitamin C. All drugs for glaucoma
are seriously toxic, and vitamin C has no
toxicity yet known. The patients experiencedmany other good side effects from vitamin C
such as clearing of sinusitis, allergy symp-

It is an interesting observation that indi-
viduals who take vitamin C regularly and
have their intraocular pressure taken on a
routine basis for their eye exam have pres-sures in the range of 10-13 mm of mercury
commonly. It has been my experience that I
have yet to find the first patient with apressure over 20 mm who comes into the
EARLY EVIDENCE ABOUT VITAMIN C AND THE COMMON COLD
present paper is that the evidence for this
protective effect was already moderately strong
by 1942 (Glazebrook and Thomson; Cowan,
Diehl, and Baker), and was very strong by 1961.
Despite the strength of the evidence, which has
been systematically misrepresented by the
medical and nutritional authorities, the possible
value of an increased intake of vitamin C in
decreasing the amount of suffering and loss of

lowering the pressure in glaucoma datesback to 1962 as reported in Experimental
Eye Research.
